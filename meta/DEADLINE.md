## Part 1: App Description

> This app is designed to give users the ability to compare and contrast
> 2 stocks of their choice by viewing side-by-side linecharts of each
> stock's year-to-date closing prices. This data was provided by the
> Polygon.io API. The ticker in the Polygon.io API is then used to connect
> to the NewsAPI which presents users with 5-10 relevant articles to browse.
> Relevancy is under the control of the NewsAPI.

## Part 2: New

> I learned how to utilize multiple APIs together to create an app
> that carries real utility in the real world. I also learned about U
> design and how to build an approachable and user-friendly interface within
> the app.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

> If I were given the chance to start this app from the beginning, I would spend
> more time researching API's and the different options available. I would note
> response structure of each API and look for one that may offer more data on the
> financial state of different stocks and companies. This would create an oppurtunity
> for my app to compare the financial statements of each company, then be able to
> give a non-professional recommendation as to which stock/company is a better buy.
